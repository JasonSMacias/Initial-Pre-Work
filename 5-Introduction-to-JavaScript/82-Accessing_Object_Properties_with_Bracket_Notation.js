// In this lesson I learned how to use bracket notation to access properties of an object, and how this is how a property with a space in its name must be accessed

// Setup
var testObj = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line

var entreeValue = testObj['an entree'];   // Change this line
var drinkValue = testObj['the drink'];    // Change this line
