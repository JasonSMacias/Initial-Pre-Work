// In this lesson I learned how to use the += operator to concatenate strings to the end of existing string variables

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";

myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
