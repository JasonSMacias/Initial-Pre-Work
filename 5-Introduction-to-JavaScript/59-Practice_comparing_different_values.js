// In this lesson I got some practice comparing values with the two types of equality operators, and also how to use the typeof operator to test the type of a value

// Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
  if (a === b) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}

// Change this value to test
compareEquality(10, "10");
