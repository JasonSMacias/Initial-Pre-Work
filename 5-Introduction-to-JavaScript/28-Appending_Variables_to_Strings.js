// In this lesson I learned how to append a variable to the end of a string using the += operator

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "interesting";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
