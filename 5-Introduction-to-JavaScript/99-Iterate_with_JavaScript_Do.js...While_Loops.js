// In this lesson I learned how to use do...while loops and how they differ from while loops in letting the code in the curly brackets to run once regardless of whether the condition is met or not

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
